easytel
=======

A simplified interface for telnet sessions in Python. Usable as a command line interface or as an easily importable end user class.

Inspired by and derived from Corey Goldberg's [TelnetController.py script](http://goldb.org/telnetpython.html) 
that you can find on [his website](http://goldb.org/).
